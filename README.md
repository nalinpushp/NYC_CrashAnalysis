# NYC_CrashAnalysis
Aim : Analysis of crashes of NYC and weather correlation using Python, Machine Learning and Power BI 

Project Description : The project NYC Motor Vehicle Crash Analysis aims to understand correlations, patterns and analysis trends with the weather conditions in the area of the crash.The steps involve scraping weather data from wunderground for NYC using Beautiful soup.Doing an EDA on Weather Data and Crash Data and finding patterns. Processed and mapped the crash dataset with weather dataset using PySpark.MongoDb Atlas was used for data storage.ML models like logistic regression,SVM and Gradient Boosting are evaluated to predict severity of a vehicle crash.For Visualization Power BI and AMCharts were used in a webpage.

Platform : Python, Machine Learning, MongoDB, PowerBI
